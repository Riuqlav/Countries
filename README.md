# Country : Population

The purpose is displaying from a mock API Countries and their respective population.

It is divided into 3 main visual elements, All countries, Top countries, Bottom countries.

The 3 main visual elements can assign a flag from input countries fetching from a external API.

## All countries

Displays responsively `All countries` and Sum of population at the top.

## TOP countries

Displays responsively `TOP countries` (population-wise) and Sum of population at the top.

## BOTTOM countries

Displays responsively `BOTTOM countries` (population-wise), filtering the ones with 0 population, and Sum of population at the top.

## How to Use

The way to use the application is very simple,

In the `input fields` you can type a real or pretended country and population, they will automatically show up in the list and will be assign a flag.

Since it can accept any countries, on any of the 3 sections, the list can get very big, so `Ctrl+F` the name of the country you'd like to know the population/flag of and you will find it!

### `Last notes`

This Challenge was very fun, and I took liberty to change some things to improve the UI/UX.

There are several little things I'd like to improve that go much beyond the assignment.

I might be re-visiting it and adding more features.
